        Nikola Jokic, born February 19, 1995 in Sombor, Serbia, is the cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets franchise. 
        Drafted 41st overall in the 2014 NBA Draft, Jokic has defied expectations to become one of the most dominant players in the league. 
        Known for his exceptional basketball IQ, court vision, and unselfish playmaking, Jokic revolutionized the center position by combining size and finesse with guard-like passing ability.

        In the 2022–23 season, Jokic led the Denver Nuggets to their first ever NBA Championship, where he was named the Finals MVP.
